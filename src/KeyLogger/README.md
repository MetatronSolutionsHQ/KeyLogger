### 1. Keylogger: Unencrypted
This script does not implement any encryption and sends the unencrypted data to a Discord channel via a webhook.

**Features:**  
- Captures keystrokes, including special keys.
- Sends keystroke logs to a specified Discord webhook.

**Usage:**  
1. Set the Discord Webhook URL in the script:
   ```
   discord_webhook_url = "YOUR_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL"
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python Keylogger.py
   ```

### 2. Keylogger: Encrypted

This script captures keystrokes and sends them to a Discord channel via a webhook. The keystroke data is encrypted before being sent, ensuring the data remains secure during transmission.

**Features:**  
- Captures keystrokes, including special keys.
- Encrypts keystroke logs using `Fernet` encryption before sending them to Discord.
- Sends keystroke logs to a specified Discord webhook.

**Usage:**  
1. Set the Discord Webhook URL in the script:
   ```
   discord_webhook_url = "YOUR_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL"
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python Keylogger-En.py
   ```
4. The script will:
   - Generate or load an encryption key from a file (`encryption_key.key`).
   - Capture and encrypt keystrokes.
   - Send the encrypted data to Discord in 50 keystroke batches or every 10 seconds, whichever comes first.

### 3. Decryptor

This script decrypts encrypted content using the cryptography.fernet library. It loads an encryption key from a file and decrypts the provided encrypted data.

**Features:**  
- loads an encryption key from a specified file (`encryption_key.key`).
- Decrypts the provided encrypted content.
- Outputs the decrypted message.

**Usage:**  
1. Ensure you have the encryption key file (`encryption_key.key`) generated by the keylogger or another script using Fernet encryption.
2. Replace the `encrypted_content` variable with the actual encrypted data that you want to decrypt:
   ```python
   encrypted_content = "gAAAAA..."  # Replace with actual encrypted data
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python decryptor.py
   ```
4. The script will:
   - Load the encryption key from the file (`encryption_key.key`).
   - Decrypt the encrypted content.
   - Print the decrypted message.
